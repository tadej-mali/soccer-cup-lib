# Data structures
## Team
A simple class describing a team participating in the match.

Each team is uniquely identified by its Id assigned by the backend. 

Since world cup is an international event, the name of the team needs to be localized (e.g. England, Anglija, Inghilterra, Angleterre...)
which is another rationale to use a machine generated unique identifier as a team Id.
